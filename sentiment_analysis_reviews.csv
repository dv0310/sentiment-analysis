The masterpiece without a message,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.

It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.

The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.

Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""

What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.

There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.

Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.","one of the early scenes in ""pulp fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a big mac is called in other countries. their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. if you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. yet without such scenes, ""pulp fiction"" wouldn't be ""pulp fiction."" i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured. it's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended. the film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. but there is no deeper explanation.

A masterpiece of screenwriting,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.","this is tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. it has arguably one of

The rebirth of a genre – and film history,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.

If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.

"It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!","My oh my. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie. It is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated. It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. They all leave lasting impressions as well. Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar. Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition. Easily 5 stars out of 5.","my oh my.

My Favourite Movie,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.","pulp fiction is the most original, rule breaking film i have ever seen. instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, pulp fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. i highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.",pulp fiction is the most original rule breaking film i have ever seen instead of following the widely used 3 act structure pulp fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasnt analysed enough i highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time,pulp fiction is the most original rule breaking film i have ever seen instead of following the widely used 3 act structure pulp fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasnt analysed enough i highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time,pulp fiction original rule breaking film ever seen instead following widely used 3 act structure pulp fiction makes 3 stories may seem completely disconnected first look closely find underlying themes share anyone says movie lacks focus meaning hasnt analysed enough highly recommend film since number one list favourite movies time,pulp fiction original rule breaking film ever seen instead following widely used 3 act structure pulp fiction makes 3 stories may seem completely disconnected first look closely find underlying themes share anyone says movie lacks focus meaning hasn analyzed enough highly recommend film since number one list favourite moves time,"['pulp', 'fiction', 'original', 'rule', 'breaking', 'film', 'ever', 'seen', 'instead', 'following', 'widely', 'used', '3', 'act', 'structure', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'makes', '3', 'stories', 'may', 'seem', 'completely', 'disconnected', 'first', 'look', 'closely', 'find', 'underlying', 'themes', 'share', 'anyone', 'says', 'movie', 'lacks', 'focus', 'meaning', 'hasn', 'analyzed', 'enough', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'since', 'number', 'one', 'list', 'favourite', 'moves', 'time']",pulp fiction origin rule break film ever seen instead follow wide use 3 act structur pulp fiction make 3 stori may seem complet disconnect first look close find underli theme share anyon say movi lack focu mean hasn analyz enough highli recommend film sinc number one list favourit move time,pulp fiction origin rule break film ever seen instead follow wide use 3 act structur pulp fiction make 3 stori may seem complet disconnect first look close find underli theme share anyon say movi lack focu mean hasn analyz enough highli recommend film sinc number one list favourit move time,Positive

One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well.

One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few.

The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time...

A Bit Over Rated But Good,"I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.

The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.

But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""King of Films"". Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.

7/10","i did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because i love the casting in it: john travolta, samuel l. jackson and uma thurman. the movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. and in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too. but, to me, the movie is overrated. it seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""king of films"". yes pulp fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film. 7/10",i did like pulp fiction to a degree  that is mainly because i love the casting in it john travolta samuel l jackson and uma thurman the movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch and in some ways the movie does live up to its hype because the story is well written and acted out good too but to me the movie is overrated it seems that some of the people that loves this movie will acttalk like its the only movie worth watching  like it is the king of films yes pulp fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching  not just this film 710,i did like pulp fiction to a degree  that is mainly because i love the casting in it john travolta samuel l jackson and uma thurman the movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch and in some ways the movie does live up to its hype because the story is well written and acted out good too but to me the movie is overrated it seems that some of the people that loves this movie will acttalk like its the only movie worth watching  like it is the king of films yes pulp fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching  not just this film 710,like pulp fiction degree mainly love casting john travolta samuel l jackson uma thurman movie good crime thriller movie lovers watch ways movie live hype story well written acted good movie overrated seems people loves movie acttalk like movie worth watching like king films yes pulp fiction good movie many great movies enjoy watching film 710,like pulp fiction degree mainly love casting john travolta samuel l jackson ma human movie good crime thrilled movie lovers watch ways movie live hope story well written acted good movie operated seems people loves movie attack like movie worth watching like king films yes pulp fiction good movie many great moves enjoy watching film 710,"['like', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'degree', 'mainly', 'love', 'casting', 'john', 'travolta', 'samuel', 'l', 'jackson', 'ma', 'human', 'movie', 'good', 'crime', 'thrilled', 'movie', 'lovers', 'watch', 'ways', 'movie', 'live', 'hope', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'good', 'movie', 'operated', 'seems', 'people', 'loves', 'movie', 'attack', 'like', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'like', 'king', 'films', 'yes', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'good', 'movie', 'many', 'great', 'moves', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', '710']",like pulp fiction degre mainli love cast john travolta samuel l jackson ma human movi good crime thrill movi lover watch way movi live hope stori well written act good movi oper seem peopl love movi attack like movi worth watch like king film ye pulp fiction good movi mani great move enjoy watch film 710,like pulp fiction degre mainli love cast john travolta samuel l jackson ma human movi good crime thrill movi lover watch way movi live hope stori well written act good movi oper seem peopl love movi attack like movi worth watch like king film ye pulp fiction good movi mani great move enjoy watch film 710,Positive

Brilliantly constructed.,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.

Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.","""pulp fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. the many

Unbelievable.,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.","pulp fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by

"Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?

Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.

Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10","it kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for pulp fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. as a film it needs no introduction,

One of the best movies of the century!,,,,,,,[],,,Neutral
Awesome!,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.

First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).

Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.

Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.

Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.

In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.

Lightning in a Bottle,"So original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant writing, dialogue, and character creation, in addition to all-time standout performances by every single actor, which means the directing was also superb.

Some people may still question what it's about because for the most part we have four different stories converging at various coordinates in a timeline loop that do not clearly have a meaning as to why other than to just have creative fun with the way it's told.

You have a philosophizing, bible thumping hitman (Samuel L Jackson) finding his path to salvation and restored faith and theism while participating in the events that comprise the movie. This movie is perfect in so many scenes with only a few weak parts. It's loaded with memorable lines, and it was meticulously cared for into every last detail including the music and what dance moves characters should have in addition to the outrageously brilliant screenplay that somehow never slips over the top.

Tarantino still hasn't even come close to this lightning in a bottle masterpiece.","so original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant

"Fun cult film, tad overrated","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.","conflicted on this one. i like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and

gets interesting though. the first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. i do think this film is slightly overrated. that's not to say that it isn't good, but i think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. the film is acted well and i enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. i found it really hilarious. i see why everyone had/has a crush on uma thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. i also remembered how much i like long shots. i think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.",conflicted on this one i like a lot

Simply The Best,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.","to put this in context, i am 34

One of the best films of the 90s,"What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox","what can i say? this film is amazing, and i would go further and say it is my favourite quentin tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. the cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a tarantino film actually. the plot is every bit as compelling as that for reservoir dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. the direction is superb, as are the performances. as excellent as uma thurman, bruce willis and christopher walken are, the film's best actors are john travolta and samuel l.jackson who are unforgettable. pulp fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. all in all, brilliant. 10/10 bethany cox",what can i say this film is amazing and i would go further and say it is my favourite quentin tarantino film and one of my favourites of the 90s the cinematography and scenery are spellbinding and the soundtrack is brilliant one of the best soundtracks in a tarantino film actually the plot is every bit as compelling as that for reservoir dogs while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hardboiled the direction is superb as are the performances as excellent as uma thurman bruce willis and christopher walken are the films best actors are john travolta and samuel ljackson who are unforgettable pulp fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing all in all brilliant 1010 bethany cox,what can i say this film is amazing and i would go further and say it is my favourite quentin tarantino film and one of my favourites of the 90s the cinematography and scenery are spellbinding and the soundtrack is brilliant one of the best soundtracks in a tarantino film actually the plot is every bit as compelling as that for reservoir dogs while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hardboiled the direction is superb as are the performances as excellent as uma thurman bruce willis and christopher walken are the films best actors are john travolta and samuel ljackson who are unforgettable pulp fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing all in all brilliant 1010 bethany cox,say film amazing would go say favourite quentin tarantino film one favourites 90s cinematography scenery spellbinding soundtrack brilliant one best soundtracks tarantino film actually plot every bit compelling reservoir dogs dialogue endlessly quotable quite hardboiled direction superb performances excellent uma thurman bruce willis christopher walken films best actors john travolta samuel ljackson unforgettable pulp fiction also wealth characters crossplots really quite astonishing brilliant 1010 bethany cox,say film amazing would go say favourite question tarutino film one favourite was cinematography scenery spellbinding soundtrack brilliant one best soundtracks tarutino film actually plot every bit compelling reservoir dogs dialogue endless suitable quite hardboiled direction superb performances excellent ma human bruce willis christopher walked films best actors john travolta samuel jackson unforgettable pulp fiction also wealth characters crossplots really quite astonishing brilliant 1010 betray cox,"['say', 'film', 'amazing', 'would', 'go', 'say', 'favourite', 'question', 'tarutino', 'film', 'one', 'favourite', 'was', 'cinematography', 'scenery', 'spellbinding', 'soundtrack', 'brilliant', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', 'tarutino', 'film', 'actually', 'plot', 'every', 'bit', 'compelling', 'reservoir', 'dogs', 'dialogue', 'endless', 'suitable', 'quite', 'hardboiled', 'direction', 'superb', 'performances', 'excellent', 'ma', 'human', 'bruce', 'willis', 'christopher', 'walked', 'films', 'best', 'actors', 'john', 'travolta', 'samuel', 'jackson', 'unforgettable', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'also', 'wealth', 'characters', 'crossplots', 'really', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'brilliant', '1010', 'betray', 'cox']",say film amaz would go say favourit question tarutino film one favourit wa cinematographi sceneri spellbind soundtrack brilliant one best soundtrack tarutino film actual plot everi bit compel reservoir dog dialogu endless suitabl quit hardboil direct superb perform excel ma human bruce willi christoph walk film best actor john travolta samuel jackson unforgett pulp fiction also wealth charact crossplot realli quit astonish brilliant 1010 betray cox,say film amaz would go say favourit question tarutino film one favourit wa cinematographi sceneri spellbind soundtrack brilliant one best soundtrack tarutino film actual plot everi bit compel reservoir dog dialogu endless suitabl quit hardboil direct superb perform excel ma human bruce willi christoph walk film best actor john travolta samuel jackson unforgett pulp fiction also wealth charact crossplot realli quit astonish brilliant 1010 betray cox,Positive
"Overrated without a doubt, but nevertheless well made","This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.

I was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, ""oh, hey, I recognize this image!"" That was the most joy I got out of this.

By no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance. I would like to speak to every single person who gives this a 10 and have them explain to me what exactly this film does well, because I feel pretty confident everyone just gets in line and calls it amazing because that is the 'cool' thing to do.","this movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. there is no point. it is not particularly funny. it is not particularly thought

One of My Favorite Movies Ever,"The hit-men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side.

""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the winner and weakest ""Forrest Gump"") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. ""Pump Fiction"" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult ""Reservoir Dogs"". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.

Enormously Overrated,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.

I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.

Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.

The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.

The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.

That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy.","the proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. the proof of the movie is in the

The most ludicrously inflated reputation of any film,"The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.

The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.

Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.

Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.

""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest.

Iconic.,"Pulp Fiction is to be seen to be believed, it was big, it was brash, it certainly arrived with a bang.

One of the most stylish films ever made, Quentin Tarantino delivered something that viewers had been starved of for so many years, Pulp Fiction offered wondering very keen, like a new voice.

Le Big Mac, that scene where Jules and Vincent are rambling on about McDonalds, just before doing a hit, that's one of.my favourite moments, the iconic moment though, Vincent and Mia dancing, it has to be one of the greatest movie scenes of all time, Chuck Berry, a scene I repeat and repeat, it's sublime.

I'm not even sure if I like the storyline or not, it's maybe a little trashy, it just doesn't matter somehow, the film's good points are turbocharged enough to hide over any cracks. It's wonderfully violent, incredibly well paced, and full of action.

Astonishing cast, Travolta at his best, Jackson, Thurman, Keitel, Roth, Willis, the names are endless, brilliant.

The music, the music is just astonishing, it's what ears were designed for, you'll watch this and you'll be reaching for the soundtrack.

'And you will know my name is the lord!! When I lay my vengeance upon thee....',"An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status.

Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece,"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.

It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.

Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.

The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.

Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.","tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. his first film, reservoir dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in four rooms was by far the greatest (even though rodriguez's was excellent too)and jackie brown is a wonderful homage to the blaxploitation films of the 70's. however, pulp fiction remains my favourite. it was nominated for so many oscars that i still find it hard to believe that it only got one: best original script. i'm not complaining because forrest gump got best picture, since that film was also oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like tarantino's or the shawshank redemption deserved much more. anyway, going back to the movie, i particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, mr. wolf, appears on the third. bruce willis also does a great job, and as far as i'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. i like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with bruce willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with uma thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point. the other star is samuel l. jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations.

far as im concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script i like the way his character gives a tough guy image at the beginning and then we discover hes so affectionate and tender to his wife travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with bruce willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with uma thurman is when the movie reaches its highest point the other star is samuel l jackson who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger is my favourite quote summarizing pulp fiction is a modern classic and a mustsee for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is i give it a 9 out of 10,tarantino without doubt one best directors

One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino... but I think it's not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.,"This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a ""safe bet"", but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.

The film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.

For many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).

These are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the ""pulp"" literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't... watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible... it's the kind of ""literature"" that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.

The actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.

Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.","this was one of the films that consolidated tarantino's career

Talk Fiction. Overrated and overpraised disappointment,"I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.

Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.

So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.

Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head.","i will never understand why pulp fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. quentin tarintino's first film reservoir dogs was amazing. it had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. when pulp fiction came out in my country in october 1994, i could not wait to see it. empire magazine gave it 5 stars. i remember when i went up to glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like star wars or indiana jones. oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of samuel jackson's character. he just talked and talked and talked and....talked. john travolta's vince vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with uma thurman in a silly black wig. there was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. i have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage jack nicholson flick wolf. tosh. so i kept hoping

A One line summary is too much for this overrated piece of #&#@!,"The movie that defines the sensibilities of Generation X. That is to say its values are worthless, the story is lurid and over extended, the writer/director is overwhelmingly self-indulgent and tacky (any revelations to do with Christianity are twisted by Tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality), the violence is absolutely incredulous, and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated (Try watching some early Kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off. -- hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50's and 60's to see how much ""originality"" Tarantino has.) I'm not going to make any friends here, as this film has obviously snowed everyone who's commented on it, but who cares. Despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from Samuel L. Jackson, Pulp Fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five. It is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the Earth is from Neptune. Quentin Tarantino is NOT Orson Welles. And Pulp Fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre-occupied with body piercing and anti-depressants. Make no mistake, I am more of an atheist than a Christian, but even I am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyone's wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend you'd just wish Tony Minero would ice. If he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing he'd have given Tim Roth his wallet, told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out. Off to a flawed start as a Christian. And the fact that Tarantino lets us see that Roth and Plummer's characters aren't terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap. Then there's the completely sickening LA underworld psycho scene (a personal Tarantino fantasy?) to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in Boorman's Deliverance. Does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining? And if so , if you're ever in my town please keep driving.

Quentin Tarantino is truly one sick puppy. Sure, he DOES write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of MF and N words, but as far as talent for film-making goes he hasn't got an idea. He couldn't act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper (Spielberg gave a better performance in The Blues Brothers) and visually he has nothing to offer at all. If anyone knows his influences, and he speaks of them often, you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard (especially Howard Hawks) would phone the SWAT team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table.

And to sum up my point, what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how GREAT a film Rio Bravo is. Before any more Gen X and y'ers announce to the world that this is the greatest film ever made, PLEASE see some other movies beforehand!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Masterpiece of Characters and Dialogue,"Pulp Fiction (1994)

**** (out of 4)

Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age.","pulp fiction (1994)

Not very original,"It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly. Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object. The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two.","it seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film kiss me deadly. kiss me deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object. the main difference in style was that the humor in kiss me deadly is much more subtle, while pulp fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. because of that, i feel that kiss me deadly is the far superior of the two.",it seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film kiss me deadly kiss me deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object the main difference in style was that the humor in kiss me deadly is much more subtle while pulp fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction because of that i feel that kiss me deadly is the far superior of the two,it seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film kiss me deadly kiss me deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object the main difference in style was that the humor in kiss me deadly is much more subtle while pulp fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction because of that i feel that kiss me deadly is the far superior of the two,seems much stylistic elements movie taken 1955 film kiss deadly kiss deadly full quirky characters mysterious chest contained glowing object main difference style humor kiss deadly much subtle pulp fiction trying real hard get laugh reaction feel kiss deadly far superior two,seems much stylistic elements movie taken 1955 film kiss deadly kiss deadly full quickly characters mysterious chest contained glowing object main difference style humor kiss deadly much subtle pulp fiction trying real hard get laugh reaction feel kiss deadly far superior two,"['seems', 'much', 'stylistic', 'elements', 'movie', 'taken', '1955', 'film', 'kiss', 'deadly', 'kiss', 'deadly', 'full', 'quickly', 'characters', 'mysterious', 'chest', 'contained', 'glowing', 'object', 'main', 'difference', 'style', 'humor', 'kiss', 'deadly', 'much', 'subtle', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'trying', 'real', 'hard', 'get', 'laugh', 'reaction', 'feel', 'kiss', 'deadly', 'far', 'superior', 'two']",seem much stylist element movi taken 1955 film kiss deadli kiss deadli full quickli charact mysteri chest contain glow object main differ style humor kiss deadli much subtl pulp fiction tri real hard get laugh reaction feel kiss deadli far superior two,seem much stylist element movi taken 1955 film kiss deadli kiss deadli full quickli charact mysteri chest contain glow object main differ style humor kiss deadli much subtl pulp fiction tri real hard get laugh reaction feel kiss deadli far superior two,Positive
Energetic and imaginative - making up for it's lack of real heart with a great wealth of dialogue and characters,"Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner. Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him. Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town. In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.

It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema. At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype. While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is. The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands. Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.

The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well. The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters. It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness. There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement. Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends. This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.

The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime. This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.

The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on. Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film. He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!). His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable. Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across. Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well. Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel. Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.

Overall this is a great film. It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable.","pumpkin

enjoyable. willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across. thurman is much better here than in kill bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well. rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as whaley, arquette (times two!), stoltz, gallagher, buscemi, walken, greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by keitel. tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be. overall this is a great film. it may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. the interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable.",pumpkin and honey bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner jules and vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man marsellus wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by wallace mia wallace is marsellus wife who vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town in a flurry of violence double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder theft and drugs it is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema at that time the tv schedules were full of interviews with tarantino and lots of hype while it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990s it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now the best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is the plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect the stories are never dull and although some are better than others they all pretty much stand up well the dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane  indeed at points i did tire of the constant pop culture references but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters it is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness there is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss the reason for this is simply that we dont ever really care about the characters on that emotional level  they are players rather than friends this is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that the only other problem with the film is its glamorisation of both drugs and crime this would be a bit of a problem if i wasnt aware of the type of film it was but i was and i just accepted it like the man himself said you dont go to a metallica gig and tell the fkers to turn the volume down so too you dont watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny violent and so on the cast are very good in their various roles nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they arent playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen gangsters and their molls and so on travolta is very good its easy to forget now that he had been in the

"A good movie, but not a great movie","Pulp Fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation.

In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond? Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people.","pulp fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. the core of the movie, the blathering of vincent and jules is fun and enjoyable. bruce willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. in the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. there is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. however it is not the amazing second coming of christ as many tarantinophiles would have us all believing. many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. do we really need to watch john travolta stick a needle in uma thurmond?

A creative and slick waste of time,"You want to do something really neat? Take the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny.

An enjoyable noir story,"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.

While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing.","i don't get as much out of pulp fiction as everybody else does. i don't

Popularity and gameplay victory,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy. Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities. ""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself.

and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies,the postmodern discourse of the film because it is in the postindustrial society era is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society thus embodying commercial game and popular colors jameson pointed out that the old essentially advanced modernist boundary between the advanced culture and the socalled popular culture or business culture has been abolished and new texts have emerged that are full of forms categories and contents of cultural industries bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital the purity of aesthetics and the selfdiscipline of art have been impacted the tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics the ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy attracting audiences with popular themes flattening the depth everything is flat this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism the result is to give the audience leisure fashion relaxation surprise and no tears violence crime sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies especially in terms of violent style tarantino became a single family violence has always been the unshakable theme of quentins works and formed his black violence aesthetics violence is bloody cold game and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities pulp fiction thoroughly stylized and gamified violence it makes the audience realize that at this moment you are watching movies for entertainment so tarentino will turn violence into joke sex into joke politics into joke and history into joke it does not ask about the meaning does not reflect does not touch politics not to mention resistance the bible quotes before jules killing were not intended to legitimize his murder similarly the scene of mias overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts black has also been treated as a piece of joke both vincent and jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood in order not to let the police find it but also in order not to add trouble to their friends they had to do it within 40 minutes cleaning the car is a very technical task so that they have to hire a special problemsolving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work when the two bighearted men finally washed themselves and the car afterwards while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny tshirts standing in front of the camera a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here so some people say pulp fiction completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to postmodernity showing that postmodern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world no longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology heroism social resistance political complaints etc some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out leaving only the image itself and the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing its circular structure clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops pulp fiction tells us in life violence including wars and boxing is omnipresent there is no justice in life and death right or wrong in front of it although quentin tarantino has never talked about postmodernism he knows its essence he seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing

"Evil, Blood and Gore Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?""","Spoilers

This movie says that life sometimes sends a message from God so we should listen. This plot moves in and out of several related stories and the time-line jumbles around so that the way it is presented, it enables us to see the hand of God. We see justice served and spirituality wins out and the evil gets killed, and/or embarrassed and/or other nasty things.

We start the movie in a restaurant and watch a husband and wife robbery team begin a robbery. There are two hit men in that restaurant. We move in and out of a story of the two hit men who work for a mobster named Marcel. We watch the hit men pull off a hit and get the money that the victim (played by Frank Whaley) owed the mobster Marcel. I got a real kick out of Whaley repeating ""What?"". The hit-man points his gun and says: ""Go ahead, say ""What"" again! I dare ya! I double dare ya! Then Whaley's character says ""What?"". BLAM! He is shot in the leg.

We watch as one of the hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) takes Marcel's wife out on the town, per Marcel's orders. Vega fears his boss Marcel's jelousy. Additionally, Marcel's wife ODs. Then we watch a frantic rescue effort bring her back.

We watch as a boxer (played Bruce Willis) is told and paid by Marcel to throw a fight. Instead this boxer pummels his opponent to death in the first round. Then he attempts to gettaway with the help of a lady cab driver, who was turned on by the killing.

There are many more surprises in this movie and a reason why I called this ""Evil Blood and Guts Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?"". Every minute of this movie should make you look at the screen with your eyes opening very wide and quote Frank Whaley's character ""What?""

This is easily one of the best movies ever and many have tried to repeat it, but never come close.","spoilers this movie says that life sometimes sends a message from god so we should listen. this

Classic Pulpy Amusement,"It's no surprise that 'Pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clichéd and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also there's a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. There's also a certain ambiguity about it. It's not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then there's the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt there's anything to say about 'Pulp Fiction' that hasn't been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing.","it's no surprise that 'pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history

lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted also theres a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing theres also a certain ambiguity about it its not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned ringolots of questions and the answers are open for discussion the cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic then theres the outstanding cast that includes john travolta samuel l jackson tim roth bruce willis uma thurman rosanne arquette eric stoltz ving rhames maria de medeires and amanda plummer all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery there are so many classic scenes that people discuss even today my personal favourites are the date sequence and the scenes that follow with travolta and thurman and the series of conversations between travolta and jackson i doubt theres anything to say about pulp fiction that hasnt been said whether one likes it or not this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies i have already seen it at least

Ezekiel 25:17,"""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.""

The opening scene of this film is a film school classic. The dance scene with Travolta & Thurman is a film school classic.

The entire film is film school required.

What can I say?

Perfect from start to end.

Enjoy!","""the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee."" the opening scene of this film is a film school classic. the dance scene with travolta & thurman is a film school classic. the entire film is film school required. what can i say? perfect from start to end. enjoy!",the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee the opening scene of this film is a film school classic the dance scene with travolta  thurman is a film school classic the entire film is film school required what can i say perfect from start to end enjoy,the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee the opening scene of this film is a film school classic the dance scene with travolta  thurman is a film school classic the entire film is film school required what can i say perfect from start to end enjoy,path righteous man beset sides inequities selfish tyranny evil men blessed name charity good shepherds weak valley darkness truly brothers keeper finder lost children strike upon thee great vengeance furious anger would attempt poison destroy brothers know name lord lay vengeance upon thee opening scene film film school classic dance scene travolta thurman film school classic entire film film school required say perfect start end enjoy,path righteous man beset sides iniquities selfish tyranny evil men blessed name charity good shepherds weak valley darkness truly brothers keeper finder lost children strike upon thee great vengeance furious anger would attempt poison destroy brothers know name lord lay vengeance upon thee opening scene film film school classic dance scene travolta human film school classic entire film film school required say perfect start end enjoy,"['path', 'righteous', 'man', 'beset', 'sides', 'iniquities', 'selfish', 'tyranny', 'evil', 'men', 'blessed', 'name', 'charity', 'good', 'shepherds', 'weak', 'valley', 'darkness', 'truly', 'brothers', 'keeper', 'finder', 'lost', 'children', 'strike', 'upon', 'thee', 'great', 'vengeance', 'furious', 'anger', 'would', 'attempt', 'poison', 'destroy', 'brothers', 'know', 'name', 'lord', 'lay', 'vengeance', 'upon', 'thee', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'film', 'school', 'classic', 'dance', 'scene', 'travolta', 'human', 'film', 'school', 'classic', 'entire', 'film', 'film', 'school', 'required', 'say', 'perfect', 'start', 'end', 'enjoy']",path righteou man beset side iniqu selfish tyranni evil men bless name chariti good shepherd weak valley dark truli brother keeper finder lost children strike upon thee great vengeanc furiou anger would attempt poison destroy brother know name lord lay vengeanc upon thee open scene film film school classic danc scene travolta human film school classic entir film film school requir say perfect start end enjoy,path righteou man beset side iniqu selfish tyranni evil men bless name chariti good shepherd weak valley dark truli brother keeper finder lost child strike upon thee great vengeanc furiou anger would attempt poison destroy brother know name lord lay vengeanc upon thee open scene film film school classic danc scene travolta human film school classic entir film film school requir say perfect start end enjoy,Positive

Great,"Good day, dear friends and dear readers of reviews! Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions. Thanks for your attention.","good day, dear friends and dear readers of reviews! today i want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised american crime thriller 1994 ""pulp fiction"".

Pulp fiction (1994) miner spoilers,"SURPRISE!!! One of the most celebrated and acclaimed movies of all time is a damn masterpiece.

Pulp fiction is one of my favourite films ever and for good reason: -the amazingly genius nonlinear story telling -one of the most enjoyable performances of all time from Samuel l. Jackson. -and of course the dialogue

Look, as someone who has seen all of Quentin Tarantino's great contributions to cinema history I can officially declare Pulp Fiction is still his best. After more than 25 years of being endlessly copied but never replicated there's a reason people still watch this movie so often.

One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!,"What is the big deal with this movie? The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters. I just don't get why people like this film so much. It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.

Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:

The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there. The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity. What on earth was Quentin thinking?

The best way to describe this movie is ""just a bunch of STUFF"", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere? I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.

What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says ""Don't be a square"" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)? That was so STUPID!!! I just don't get stuff like that. Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy? Where the f&*k is the comedy? Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat? That isn't funny, that's SICK! The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon. I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.

I'll never say ""don't waste you're time"" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it. I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,

Decent but it's not a masterpiece to me,"Throughout the years I often heard how Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time. It wasn't until today I finally had taken the time to sit down and watch this for the first time from start to finish to see what all the fuss is about. Needless to say, this is a very mixed bag for me

What I like about Pulp Fiction is the plot being all jumbled up and not straight forward like many other movies where you see how everything begins and ends. Pulp Fiction doesnt do that. It's back to front so to speak starting at the end but going backwards. It feels disconnected and out of place as it tells different stories but they are actually are all connected in a way

I also liked the deep themes and talks of existentialism, nihilism and philosophical talks of God with some of the characters. It also helped the movie had a great star studded cast to give Pulp Fiction and extra umph to it

What I dont like is the subplot for Burce Willis's character that involved him and a mob boss being tied up and were about to be raped by two guys with the mob boss getting raped. I hate rape and I hate how it's used in media. It's just awful and always feel sick about it. If I had known rape was a factor in Pulp Fiction I would not have bothered at all. Thankfully though the rapists get what's coming to them in the end

I also didnt like how some scenes and dialogue with the characters fell flat where nothing really happens and it just drags on and on. I actually didnt start to like or get interested until Bruce Willis is in a shootout with the mob boss character but then the rape part comes ugh.

Overall this movie was decent and I have no regrets in taking the time to watch this for my Sunday morning. It's definitely not a movie I'd be considered in watching again, once is enough for me and not to add to my ever growing DVD collection.","throughout the years i often heard how pulp fiction is a

"I dare you, I double dare you if you don't love this movie! 8/10","First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest.

"So nostalgic, superbly-acted, and so 90-stylish","This is one of movie that raising Tarantino to an apex level. He was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. Reservoir dogs, his first movie, is one kind of movie, using a similar 90s retro theme. Those style was an inheritance of Tarantino, it was his original natural-touch. His 90s movies severely enjoyable for young and mid-aged people. Nowadays, his 90s movie prevalent considered as trend-setter which used by so many directors nowadays, for example lets look at kill bill. Stylish but harsh with slow-mo action shot and consider the raid 2 and kingsman : secret service as its descendant.

Pulp fiction is a film which considered as classic. Lets try to analyze it distinctly. First thing first, i am gonna highlight the performance of Samuel L Jackson. Indisputably, Jacksons performance is potent. You cant contest this level of characterization without any serious contemplation, because in this movie, Jackson ranked highly in top performance of all time category. Even an amateur audience could say this level of acting is above average. I even feel scared by his act (interrogating scene), its like I've been really charged by a verdict and witness him ready to gut me was really haunting and obnoxious.

Secondly, the writing. Honestly, the plot could drive me from not in a mod into a freak. The joy element implicitly delivered from the writing to the audience. The interrogating scene, driving scene (in early duration), and of course the magnificent dancing scene. All these scenes were devoted by great screenplay technique. For example lets take a look and analyze the interrogating scene. Watch and remember Jacksons movement and watch the camera position carefully. At early, Tarantino using some establishing shot and some full-shot to all characters inside. It brings an introduction message while giving suspense to audience. Jacksons movement from outside the door to in the middle of the room to in front of sofa is a support to these shots. It sends horror expression to the interrogated characters. Then lately, while berating and punishing Tarantino using close-up shot and extreme close-up shot to execute. These give a huge pressure and impoverishing the morale of interrogated person. The force of pressure intensified by slow-paced play as Jackson moving. Those was an example of incredible screenplay and writing technique. This technique also used by legendary director Sergio Leone to his western movies.

The 90s euphoria direction was the highest aspect of this movie. It shape the whole film with joyful nostalgic of 90s, such as the music and pop culture. The nostalgic invention of this new movie in 90s permeated to the whole audience until now. It persist as a classic nowadays. Tarantino was a terrific boy these day.","this is one of movie that raising tarantino to an apex level. he was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. reservoir dogs, his

A Perfect follow-up to Reservoir Dogs!,,,,,,,[],,,Neutral
8 - Great,"Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue.

This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry.","pulp fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. with all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to

Masterful even in a RPX theater,"Always a phenomenal experience especially the music and extremely well done acting!

"The More You Watch, The Better It Gets","Would it be too much to say Tarantino re-invented the cinema with this film? I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. You can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime. Despite originally thinking it was slightly overhyped, seeing it again and again has brought me to realise what it is. It's 'Pulp Fiction' and it's amazing.","would it be too much to say tarantino re-invented the cinema with this film? i can only speak for myself, but i had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. you can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'pulp fiction'. probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially sam jackson);

Perfectly made in every way,"PULP FICTION has a reputation of being one of the best movies of all time. It's #8 on IMDB's top 250, it has a score of 8,9 and it has tons of positive reviews. After seeing it nearly a month ago I told myself ''I was right!''

The acting is excellent by everyone. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the highlights in the cast and this movie helped their careers a lot. Bruce Willis gives one of his most memorable performances ever as a former boxer that ends to go out of town with his girlfriend after saving his former boss (Ving Rhames) in a holdup. Uma Thurman shines as the boss' wife and in supporting roles Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Tim Roth are very good and entertaining to watch. Quentin Tarantino's direction is top-notch and the cinematography is slick and stylish. The soundtrack is great and memorable. The only complaint I have is that at times there are some violent moments, but since it's the only problem I cut it here.

Since there are more than 2,800 reviews for this movie already I won't try to give a deep analisys or discussing the plot. Just watch it and enjoy.","pulp fiction has a reputation of being one of the best movies of all time. it's #8 on imdb's top 250, it has a score of 8,9 and it has tons of positive reviews. after seeing

Quentin Tarantino's second strike.,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.

A lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""The Presidio"" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing ""Pulp Fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.

There are essentially three stories in ""Pulp Fiction,"" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""Deliverance.""

Back to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction."" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates ""Pulp Fiction"" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.

5/5.","quentin tarantino's ""pulp fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. like all great directors, q.t. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. a lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""pulp fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. and not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. it's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time. a lesser director than tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. instead, tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: he actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. most critics interpret this as quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. they're wrong. the dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. the difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""the presidio"" isn't real at all. the characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. no doubt jules and vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. one must keep in mind that we actually hear little about jules and vincent, and even less talk between them. but when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. and this is what so many people miss when viewing ""pulp fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when jules (samuel l. jackson) and vincent (john travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the french translate the term ""quarter pounder with cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: quentin later uses this same reference for jules before he and vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from marsellus wallace (ving rhames), one of the town's major kingpins. there are essentially three stories in ""pulp fiction,"" intertwined between one another. it opens with honey bunny (amanda plummer) and her boyfriend (tim roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. by their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? the stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following jules and vincent, who work for marsellus, who has paid championship boxer butch (bruce willis) to fall in his upcoming match. but butch has a better plan: bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. he almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""deliverance."" back to the dialogue. it is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. it's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. for example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear jules and vincent discussing the big mac and quarter pounder with cheese? no. but our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. there are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends

Sensationalistic crime flick missing one ingredient.,"Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure.

*Insert Iconic Quote Here*,"Pulp fiction is... well it's pulp fiction. It gets everything right. I initially didn't think much of this film on a first viewing but it's slowly become one of my all time favourites (yes I know that's cliché) This was Tarantino's break out flick, and as much as I love reservoir dogs I'm happy that it is. I'm let's face it, this is still his best movie. I can gush about the performances, specifically Jackson because my god is he great in this. I just wanted to mention Travolta, who disappeared after the Grease and then was crapped on after 'B:E' and 'Gotti'. He's not exactly my cup of tea but even I can admit he is great in this You've already seen it, you've got the poster on your wall.

Quentin Tarantino's Magnum Opus Is Cinematic History In The Making,"Every once in a while, a film comes along that changes everything. Whenever the industry went out of ideas & employed the same formula for too long, there always emerged a new wave of films that injected new life into this medium and in the process ended up changing the way we are accustomed to watching & perceiving motion pictures. And Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, one of those movies.

Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes & Best Screenplay at Oscars, Pulp Fiction was a force to be reckoned with at its time of release for it opened many realms that were previously thought to be non-existent and in the long run, didn't just influence cinema but other media as well. Everything about it was different from the norm and it remains one of the most original & groundbreaking stories to ever unfold on the silver screen.

Pulp Fiction intertwines three different story lines into one and is told in a nonlinear fashion. The first follows two hit men who are out to retrieve a mysterious suitcase which belongs to their boss. The second is about one of those two hit men who's put in charge of taking care of the boss' wife while he's out of town. And third concerns an aging but proud boxer who is asked to drop a fight in exchange for a handsome reward. The lives of these odd people collide in unexpected ways, resulting in some hilarious situations.

Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, his sophomore effort is even better than his debut feature which was a milestone in itself. Tarantino has injected the script with extensive pop culture references, a vast line-up of idiosyncratic characters & explosive dialogues plus the way this whole story is narrated and its wicked fusion of violence & humour turns it into an endlessly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly refreshing ride that's in a league of its own.

What's also amazing is the fact that most of the conversations taking place in the movie is not even related to the plot and is simply a casual discussion on a randomly chosen topic. And yet, without these wisecracking moments, Pulp Fiction wouldn't really be Pulp Fiction. The amount of focus that went into the smallest of details during the writing process is this film's biggest strength and when it comes to pure screenplay wizardry, Pulp Fiction has no equals & probably never will.

The technical aspects are no slouch for the picture exhibits a number of new tricks when it comes to bringing the script to life on the film canvas. Cinematography presents Tarantino adding a few more photography techniques to his sleeve that would later become his own trademarks. Editing intentionally rearranges the order in which the events unfold and keeps the viewers on their toes at all times. And the soundtrack is a compilation of rock n roll, pop & surf music that are cleverly chosen and surprisingly fit the accompanying sequences.

Two key elements that are highly contrasting in general but, in Tarantino's films, fit together as if co-dependent on each other is violence & humour. He's a rare artist who is capable of making us laugh uncontrollably at a scene that involves a person's head getting blown-off. Now there is substantial amount of violence in this picture but those violent sequences are also its funniest moments and the reason why it works so well is coz the addition of hilarity to such brutality significantly neutralizes the effect gore & violence alone may have had on the audience.

Coming to the acting department, Pulp Fiction features a star-studded cast in John Travolta ,Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, & many more, and is notable for launching & revitalising the careers of many. Travolta resurrects himself with a smashing performance in the role of Vincent Vega. Jackson not delivers his career-best work but ends up reincarnating himself for this is the movie that made Samuel L. Jackson what Samuel L. Jackson is today and he will forever be indebted to Tarantino for this.

Both Travolta & Jackson play the two hit men and their chemistry just clicks. Thurman plays Mia Wallace and is absolutely electrifying in her given role. Marsellus Wallace is a character whose presence looms over the entire story even during his absence & Ving Rhames didn't disappoint in portraying him. Willis adds another feather to his acting range and does nicely in balancing the toughness of his boxer character with a soft spot for his wife. Keitel steals every moment he is in. Roth & Plummer also have their moments to shine, and each one of them succeeds in bringing these scripted characters to life in just the right dose.

On an overall scale, with its surprisingly powerful combination of unconventional structure, stylish direction, remarkable screenplay, stellar performances, energetic pace, mesmerising soundtrack and Tarantino's patented mix of violence & humour, Pulp Fiction succeeds as a delicious piece of pop culture that thrills & amuses in a highly unusual manner and is rightly counted amongst the greatest movies ever made. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, an unsurpassed milestone in independent filmmaking, and a landmark moment in cinema history that permanently engraved Tarantino's name in the annals of filmmaking, Pulp Fiction is essential viewing in every sense of the word.

One of My Top 15!!,,,,,,,[],,,Neutral
I guess I just don't get it,,,,,,,[],,,Neutral
Damn Near Perfect,"I just finished watching Pulp Fiction

Tarantino nails his screenplay again. This type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. You either have it or you do not. Sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like Tarantino.

Too many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. The dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. I'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again.

I think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.

Whilst this movie revived John Travolta's career, it's Samuel L Jackson who steals the show. Every time I watch the movie I think he should have won the Oscar. Then I watch Ed Wood, and think Martin Landau deserved it. My opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies I last watched.

Harvey Kieren (in his second Tarantino flick) is great as Winston Wolf (I really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) Tim Roth (also in his second Tarantino flick) and Amanda Plummer fun and I can not believe I never noticed it was Steve Buscemi (also in his second Tarantino flick) as the waiter Buddy Holly at Jack Rabbit Slim's.

Pulp Fiction was a massive hit. It grossed $107 million (against an $8 million budget) At the domestic box office to end the year, as the 10th highest grossing movie of the year.","i just finished watching pulp fiction tarantino

"For Tarantino Fan Boys who want to be a ""Gangsta""","What is wrong with reviewers? Really. Have we devolved into less-than apes?

How and why does anyone rate this so highly, with an average of 8.9?

People (men), (white men), are obsessed with playing the ""gangsta,"" drugs, sex, and using the f*bomb.

This is good film??? Tarantino has been and continues to be a narcissist, and all of his fan boys like to tag along.

As much as I hate the ilk of Tarantino, his film-making skills are of high value, so all is not lost - technically.

STORY: This ""story"" is a patchwork of stories, like what Tarantino does with his other films. Arguably the central story is about two (2) hit men, but they are more like thread than fabric. The ""story"" isn't really a story with any kind of valuable message (contrary to the fan boys); no, it's more like the ""days in the lives of people living in darkness.""

The story has no intrinsic purpose or value - it's just white men wanting to (vicariously) play the ""gangsta.""

ACTING: This film has one (1) highlight - good acting. There is no character development (the director lacks this skill), but the acting is clean, crisp, and the cast remain in character throughout.

TEMPO: The pace is somewhat appropriate for its genre (whatever that is), but it too often bogs down in itself (yes, like the mythical Narcissus gets lost in his own self-affections).

CINEMATOGRAPHY: This is a reasonably well-scened film, but again, more like a ""day-in-the-life-of,"" so nothing special.

DIRECTING: Excellent skills, but I loathe the director.

Overall, if you like watching people kill, torture, curse, use illicit drugs, and you really want to be a ""gangsta,"" then by all means ... watch this.","what is wrong with reviewers? really. have we

Everything that Once upon a time in Hollywood wasn't.,"Pulp Fiction is pretty much Once upon a time in Hollywood, but better in every regard.

Pulp Fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s, that's what this movie was. A piece of art, not a movie.

This movie is all about the characters and the actors, not any plot. That's why I would rate the movie as follows

1. Characters 11

2. Acting 10

3. Plot 7

4. Cinematography 10

5. World building 10

We have stellar characters and acting. Cinematography is also amazing, it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s.","pulp fiction is pretty much once upon a time in hollywood, but better in every regard. pulp fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s, that's what this movie was. a piece of art, not a movie. this movie is all about the characters and the actors, not any plot. that's why i would rate the movie as follows 1. characters 11 2. acting 10 3. plot 7 4. cinematography 10 5. world building 10 we have stellar characters and acting. cinematography is also amazing, it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s.",pulp fiction is pretty much once upon a time in hollywood but better in every regard pulp fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s thats what this movie was a piece of art not a movie this movie is all about the characters and the actors not any plot thats why i would rate the movie as follows 1 characters 11 2 acting 10 3 plot 7 4 cinematography 10 5 world building 10 we have stellar characters and acting cinematography is also amazing it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s,pulp fiction is pretty much once upon a time in hollywood but better in every regard pulp fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s thats what this movie was a piece of art not a movie this movie is all about the characters and the actors not any plot thats why i would rate the movie as follows 1 characters 11 2 acting 10 3 plot 7 4 cinematography 10 5 world building 10 we have stellar characters and acting cinematography is also amazing it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s,pulp fiction pretty much upon time hollywood better every regard pulp fiction encapsulated defined 90s thats movie piece art movie movie characters actors plot thats would rate movie follows 1 characters 11 2 acting 10 3 plot 7 4 cinematography 10 5 world building 10 stellar characters acting cinematography also amazing really sucks world building really makes fell like 90s,pulp fiction pretty much upon time hollywood better every regard pulp fiction encapsulated defined was that movie piece art movie movie characters actors plot that would rate movie follows 1 characters 11 2 acting 10 3 plot 7 4 cinematography 10 5 world building 10 cellar characters acting cinematography also amazing really sucks world building really makes fell like was,"['pulp', 'fiction', 'pretty', 'much', 'upon', 'time', 'hollywood', 'better', 'every', 'regard', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'encapsulated', 'defined', 'was', 'that', 'movie', 'piece', 'art', 'movie', 'movie', 'characters', 'actors', 'plot', 'that', 'would', 'rate', 'movie', 'follows', '1', 'characters', '11', '2', 'acting', '10', '3', 'plot', '7', '4', 'cinematography', '10', '5', 'world', 'building', '10', 'cellar', 'characters', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'also', 'amazing', 'really', 'sucks', 'world', 'building', 'really', 'makes', 'fell', 'like', 'was']",pulp fiction pretti much upon time hollywood better everi regard pulp fiction encapsul defin wa that movi piec art movi movi charact actor plot that would rate movi follow 1 charact 11 2 act 10 3 plot 7 4 cinematographi 10 5 world build 10 cellar charact act cinematographi also amaz realli suck world build realli make fell like wa,pulp fiction pretti much upon time hollywood better everi regard pulp fiction encapsul defin wa that movi piec art movi movi charact actor plot that would rate movi follow 1 charact 11 2 act 10 3 plot 7 4 cinematographi 10 5 world build 10 cellar charact act cinematographi also amaz realli suck world build realli make fell like wa,Positive

Quentin Tarantino breaks out,"Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).

This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this.

You know what they call a 1/4 Pounder with Cheese?,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success.","probably tarantino's best

The Movie that redefined a genre,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace.

There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected.

Brilliant story telling makes this movie an unique one.,"Quentin Tarantino had done it again. If you thought he would just be an one day fly after ""Reservoir Dogs"", you couldn't be more wrong.

Once again just like in ""Reservoir Dogs"" the storytelling is unique. The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated, they are not told in the right order. It sound like the story is hard to follow, how ever this is not the case. The story is easy to follow, so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it.

The movie is filled with sex, drugs, violence and bad language. All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies.

All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!

There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.

The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.

There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken. Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movie

A must see unique movie.

It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture.,"It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture.

It's an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years. Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).

Though, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character.

If I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues.

Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.

A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever.","it's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture. it's an important film and no doubt one of the most important

The best the USA has to offer,"The USA can't offer much to the world, it's far too immature, black and childish for that but it can offer us a truly delightful film such as this masterpiece. I really liked the heavy use of drugs in this movie, it gave me tears of joy to see characters having the time of their lives on drugs and made me very nostalgic for my drug fuelled happy days as a youngster at Eton (Mess).

The heavy use of drugs, violence, profanity and sex in this film has positively influenced an entire sexy generation of British people and I can't thank the United States enough for that, from youngish Brits swearing every 5 seconds to the cheeky games of hide and seek finding marijuana in the London Underground and asking waitresses for free sex after every bad meal at restaurants, this film truly has changed British culture for the better, I'm so proud of the beautiful ex-British colony known as the United States due to this film.

The sexual abuse at the end of the film has also made the UK more aware of sexual abuse of males, this film has made many Brits more self-aware that men aren't invincible, they can be sexually abused and this film highlights the harsh brutal reality of that heinous crime so I thank this film for making Britain a safer place for men. I also really liked the diner scene, the best diner I've ever seen onscreen and just so stunningly beautiful, it truly does look heavenly that place and every happy night I have I dream of going to that diner with a few of my British mates and gently bonding with our lovely American children.","the usa can't offer much to the world, it's far too immature, black and childish for that but it can

generation of british people and i can't thank the united states enough for that, from youngish brits swearing every 5 seconds to the cheeky games of hide and seek finding marijuana in the london underground and asking waitresses for free sex after every bad meal at restaurants, this film truly has changed british culture for the better, i'm so proud of the beautiful ex-british colony known as the united states due to this film. the sexual abuse at the end of the film has also made the uk more aware of sexual abuse of males, this film has made many brits more self-aware that men aren't invincible, they can be sexually abused and this film highlights the harsh brutal reality of that heinous crime so i thank this film for making britain a safer place for men. i also really liked the diner scene, the best diner i've ever seen onscreen and just so stunningly beautiful, it truly does look heavenly that place and every happy night i have i dream of going to that diner with a few of my british mates and gently bonding with our lovely american children.",the usa cant offer much to the world its far too immature black and childish for that but it can offer us a truly delightful

this is a fantastic film,"Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations. Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe. The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance. Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry). In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time

I hate this movie,"Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all-time. I really don't understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever. It's cruel, stupid, idiotic. It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening. It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie. I hated everything about it. EVERYTHING. To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames. So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal. That doesn't make it a masterpiece. This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick. The movie is SICK. This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.

the most over valued film of the '90s,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!","pulp fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in

Deserves all the praise it has gotten over the years,"Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.

This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.

What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.

Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.

Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.

This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.

So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies.","going into this for the first time, i knew this would be a good movie and i would enjoy it. however, i had no

Ezekiel 25:17,"The film written by Quentin is truly an astonishing masterpiece. This story is divided into four parts which is hard to conclude it with several sentences. Mr. Tarantino did an perfect job on characterization. Every person was vividly portrayed. For example, at the begining of the film, Marsellus Wallace didn't show up, but we could know from the conversation between Jules and Vincent that he is such a powerful gangster and nobody who knows him dare to mess with him. And Vincent was also shaped in different angles and details. In the movie, he is a man of humer, a good partner, and the spot in this movie which is dramatic when he killed by Butch. The movie was full of black humer and it might wants to say, nobody would be the 'righteous man' in the world of violence, but their character is vividly brought to your attention by Quentin, which

Perfection ... sheer perfection!,"Not one movie can claim to have half the entertaining dialogue that this movie has. From beginning to end, not one word is out of place, or boring. Many movies may have one piece of dialogue that elevates the movie enough for you to like it, but Pulp Fiction is sheer joy of conversation, paired with situation after situation of pure excitement.

I am sure I will never seen a movie that will be this much fun again! In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction!

The movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous.

The acting is compelling. The cinematography is masterful and just sets a nostalgic mood that makes you want to return to. The direction is ... oh well ... Tarantino. And the dialogue is the best ever. Really.

Please see it.","not one movie can claim to have half the entertaining dialogue that this movie has. from beginning to end, not one word is out of place, or boring. many movies may have one piece of

Great film.,"I don't deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.

these consequences do lead to something bad it doesnt disencourage them i cant help but resent the film for the fact its usually the film that gets people into film cant disagree that it was one of the films for myself but it has been 7 viewings since since it offers absolutely nothing new it just doesnt have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything  not that id like to know to be honest if it wasnt such a cult film none of the images would recur it has a pretty flawless soundtrack though however i cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach

"Kinetic and sneaky, narcotizing and primal...","Quentin Tarantino co-wrote, directed and co-stars in this flamboyant, literate, byzantine drama which is structured like a dime-store novel. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are Los Angeles hit-men, Uma Thurman is a gangster's girl whom Travolta is asked to entertain, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run after one of his fights ended in death. Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well, resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's. Is it really that good? Yes, the verbal interplay and canny, cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating, and the performances by Travolta, Jackson and Willis (and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin) are near-perfection; however, the film's mixture of queasy, bloody violence (undermined by the jokey tone) and the barrage of foul-mouthed, low-life characters can easily become wearing.

Is Tarantino Our New Kubrick?,,,,,,,[],,,Neutral
The Quintessential '90s Film,"I saw this movie nine times in the theater when it came out; it resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genres.

The second directorial effort from then fairly unknown Tarantino but it was a brilliant sophomore effort hitting the proper notes on all the main categories; directing, score, cinematography, acting / casting, plot, writing, etc. I cannot suggest this film to everyone; you need a certain sense of humor and a certain means of looking at a plot-line to truly enjoy it, but for those that have those prerequisites this is required viewing.

This film in my top tier and one that can be watched at any time. An extremely well constructed piece of film-making that is worthy of a viewing.","i saw this movie nine times in the theater when it came out; it resonated so deeply on a level i couldn't explain at
